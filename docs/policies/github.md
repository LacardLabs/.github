# GitHub access policy (LacardLabs)
- **Git transports**: SSH for `git` and `gh` operations. HTTPS is strongly discouraged.
- **CLI**: Prefer `gh` (GitHub CLI) for GitHub objects (PRs, issues, actions).
- 
- **Headless auth**: When on SSH-only hosts, use open https://github.com/login/device on another device to enter the printed code.
