# Lacard Labs

**Welcome to the Underlabs.** We build tools so every workstation feels like a trusted collaborator rather than a chore to babysit. The `lacard` CLI provisions Ubuntu machines end-to-end, records their roles, links them to the fleet, and keeps learning alive inside every shell.

## What we are building

- **Lacard CLI** – Typer-powered command line for installing, joining, diagnosing, resetting, and observing Lacard workstations.
- **Underlabs dashboard** – Colourful login experience that greets each operator by lab name, surfaces local horsepower, and reveals the collective heartbeat of the fleet.
- **Shared rituals** – Rotating tips, agent wisdom (starting with *ladygenesis*), and gentle prompts that help newcomers contribute faster every day.

## Join the lab (not yet, but soonTM)

1. Install: `pipx install lacardlabs`.
2. Explore: `lacard help`, `lacard manual`, `lacard quickstart`.

## Ways to contribute

- Test the provisioning flow and file issues for anything that feels rough.
- Share tips or quotes to grow the rotating decks.
- Help expand [status.lacard.ca](https://status.lacard.ca) so every login reflects the health of the fleet.
- Propose new rituals or tooling in the discussions board—sign-offs welcome from every nameless Lacard.

The Underlabs are here for operators young, seasoned, and yet to arrive. Open a shell, say hello, and build with us <3
