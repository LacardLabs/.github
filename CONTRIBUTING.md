# Contributing

**Branch → Pull Request → Code Review → Squash and Merge**.

## Workflow
All repositories start from the template on GitHub.
Clone them locally with `gh repo clone LacardLabs/<repo> ~/GitHub/LacardLabs/<repo>` so shared scripts can assume that path.
Run `pwd` before committing to make sure you're inside the expected directory.

1) Create a new branch: `[user|feat|fix|task]/<description>` and commit your changes to it.
2) When all of your changes are complete and tested, open a Pull Request and fill out the template.
3) Await review from CODEOWNERS
